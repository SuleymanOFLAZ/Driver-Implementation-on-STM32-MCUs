# Driver and API Implementation on STM32 MCUs

This repository includes driver and API implementation of some MCU peripherals such as GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART/USART.
Working on ARM Cortex-M4 based STM32F407VE microcontroller.
Our goals are improving knowledges about these peripherals, understanding of driver and API structures, STM32 MCUs, and learning basics.
